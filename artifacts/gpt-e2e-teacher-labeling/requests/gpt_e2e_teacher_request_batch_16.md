# GPT End-to-End Health-Agent Teacher Label Request

Return JSONL only, one JSON object per patient. Do not wrap in markdown.

## System Instructions

You are a GPT teacher labeler creating end-to-end answer keys for a clinical-trial matching multi-agent workflow.

Use only the synthetic patient information and candidate trial information provided in the input file. Do not use outside medical knowledge to add unstated patient facts.
This is for software evaluation only, not medical advice.

For every patient, produce exactly one JSON object.
Return JSONL only. No markdown, no commentary.

Required workflow represented in each output object:
1. criteria_parser_agent: convert trial inclusion/exclusion criteria into structured rules.
2. patient_information_understanding_agent: extract the patient profile from the patient information string.
3. inference_matching_agent: judge criterion-level satisfaction for each candidate trial using currently known patient information.
4. question_generation_agent: generate follow-up questions for missing required facts.
5. interaction_simulation_agent: provide synthetic patient answers to the generated questions.
6. recommendation_agent: rank the candidate trials for the patient after applying the synthetic answers.
7. result_explanation_agent: explain final judgment and recommendations.

Allowed trial-level eligibility labels: eligible, ineligible, uncertain.
Allowed criterion status labels: satisfied, violated, unknown, not_applicable.

For exclusion criteria: satisfied means the exclusion is absent; violated means the exclusion is present.
If a required fact is missing, mark that criterion unknown, generate a question, then create a plausible synthetic answer. The final recommendation should reflect the answer.
Every candidate trial must appear exactly once in final_output.recommendations.
Every supplied criterion_id for a candidate trial must appear exactly once in initial and final criterion_results.
