# GPT End-to-End Health-Agent Teacher Label Request

Return JSONL only, one JSON object per patient. Do not wrap in markdown.

## System Instructions

You are a GPT teacher labeler creating end-to-end answer keys for a clinical-trial matching multi-agent workflow.

Use only the synthetic patient information and candidate trial information provided in the input file. Do not use outside medical knowledge to add unstated patient facts.
This is for software evaluation only, not medical advice.

For every patient, produce exactly one JSON object.
Return JSONL only. No markdown, no commentary.

Required workflow represented in each output object:
1. criteria_parser_agent: convert trial inclusion/exclusion criteria into structured rules.
2. patient_information_understanding_agent: extract the patient profile from the patient information string.
3. inference_matching_agent: judge criterion-level satisfaction for each candidate trial using currently known patient information.
4. question_generation_agent: generate follow-up questions for missing required facts.
5. interaction_simulation_agent: provide synthetic patient answers to the generated questions.
6. recommendation_agent: rank the candidate trials for the patient after applying the synthetic answers.
7. result_explanation_agent: explain final judgment and recommendations.

Allowed trial-level eligibility labels: eligible, ineligible, uncertain.
Allowed criterion status labels: satisfied, violated, unknown, not_applicable.

For exclusion criteria: satisfied means the exclusion is absent; violated means the exclusion is present.
If a required fact is missing, mark that criterion unknown, generate a question, then create a plausible synthetic answer. The final recommendation should reflect the answer.
Every candidate trial must appear exactly once in final_output.recommendations.
Every supplied criterion_id for a candidate trial must appear exactly once in initial and final criterion_results.

Patients can understand this study and capable of providing informed consent; 3. Patients with willingness to be in the study and comply with the study visit procedures and other protocol requirements; 4. Diagnosed with CD19-positive large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) based on cytology or histology according to the WHO 2016 standards, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (DLBCL-NOS), grade 3b follicular lymphoma (FL), transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL), high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) with MYC, BCL-2, and/or BCL-6 rearrangements, and high-grade B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (HGBL-NOS). For CD19 expression status, subjects with a clear past record of tumor histological diagnosis as CD19-positive (within 6 months prior to screening with no CD19-related treatment in the last 6 months) and tumors showing CD19-positive lymphoma levels >= 50% by IHC or CD19-positive lymphoma levels >= 70% by flow cytometry. If there is no previous CD19 tumor testing or the result is over 6 months prior to screening, a new tumor pathology sample must be provided or re-collected for CD19-positive diagnosis by the institution, with IHC showing CD19-positive lymphoma levels >= 50% or flow cytometry showing CD19-positive lymphoma levels >= 70%. 5. For refractory or relapsed large B-cell lymphoma subjects, must have received at least anthracycline-based therapy and rituximab (or other CD20-targeted drugs, excluding CD20-negative cases). If previously treated with R-CHOP or other CD20-targeted therapy, the best treatment outcome prior to relapse must have been complete remission (CR). Subjects should meet"
